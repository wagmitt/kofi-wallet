# Kofi Finance Disclaimer

**Last Updated: March 17, 2025**  
This Disclaimer applies to your use of Kofi Finance and/or any of its sub-domains (collectively, the "Protocol"), provided by Kofi Finance and its maintainers ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Protocol, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Disclaimer, which is incorporated into the Kofi Finance Terms of Service and Legal Disclaimer ("TOS"). If you do not agree, you must not use the Protocol.

## 1. General Disclaimer

Kofi Finance is a decentralized, Aptos-based token staking protocol designed to enable users to stake certain digital assets. The Protocol is provided for informational and operational purposes only, as a tool for technologically sophisticated individuals to interact with staking smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain. Your use of the Protocol is entirely at your own risk.

We make no representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding the Protocol, its functionality, or the information provided through it. The Protocol is offered on an **"as is"** and **"as available"** basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, reliability, or uninterrupted operation.

---

## 2. No Professional Advice

The information provided through the Protocol, including but not limited to documentation, staking parameters, or transaction data, does not constitute professional advice of any kind—legal, financial, tax, investment, or otherwise. It is not an offer, recommendation, or solicitation to buy, sell, stake, or engage in any specific activity with digital assets. You should not rely on this information as a substitute for independent research or consultation with qualified professionals. Before using the Protocol, you are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and seeking appropriate advice tailored to your circumstances.

---

## 3. Risks of Use

The Protocol operates within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which involves inherent risks. By using the Protocol, you acknowledge and assume full responsibility for the following risks, among others:

- **Volatility:** Digital assets are highly volatile, and their value may fluctuate significantly or drop to zero.
- **Smart Contract Risks:** Despite potential audits, smart contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits that could lead to loss of funds.
- **Validator Risks:** Staked assets may be subject to slashing or penalties due to validator misconduct or network rules.
- **Technical Risks:** Blockchain failures, network congestion, or Protocol upgrades may disrupt access or result in asset loss.
- **Third-Party Risks:** The Protocol relies on third-party services (e.g., wallets, Aptos blockchain nodes) that we do not control, and issues with these services (e.g., loss of private keys) may cause irretrievable losses.
- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect your ability to use the Protocol or digital assets.
- **Forks and Network Events:** Blockchain forks or other events may alter the Protocol’s operation or your assets, and we have no control over such occurrences.

This list is not exhaustive. Additional risks, known or unknown, may arise, and you accept all consequences of using the Protocol.

## 4. No Control Over Blockchain or Transactions

The Protocol is a decentralized system running on the Aptos blockchain, a public network we do not own, operate, or control. We do not custody your digital assets, private keys, or wallets, nor can we initiate, modify, reverse, or cancel transactions on your behalf. All staking transactions are executed solely through your interactions with the blockchain via third-party wallets, and you bear full responsibility for authorizing and broadcasting these transactions. We are not agents, intermediaries, or fiduciaries in your use of the Protocol.

---

## 5. Third-Party Content and Services

The Protocol may reference or integrate with third-party resources, such as wallet providers, blockchain explorers, or external documentation. We do not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for these third-party services, their content, or their accuracy. Your use of such services is at your own risk, and you should review their terms and privacy policies. We are not liable for any damages or losses arising from your reliance on or interaction with third-party offerings.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Kofi Finance, its affiliates, developers, contributors, and maintainers disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the Protocol, including but not limited to:

- Loss of profits, funds, or digital assets.
- Technical failures, interruptions, or errors in the Protocol or blockchain.
- Third-party service disruptions or wallet issues.
- Regulatory actions or changes affecting your assets.

Our total aggregate liability, if any, is limited to $0 USD, as specified in the TOS. This limitation is a fundamental condition of providing the Protocol as a free, decentralized service.

---

## 7. No Guarantees of Availability or Continuity

We do not guarantee that the Protocol will be continuously available, uninterrupted, or free from errors, defects, or vulnerabilities. We may modify, suspend, or terminate the Protocol—or any part of it—at any time, with or without notice, at our sole discretion. We are not obligated to maintain, update, or support the Protocol, and we are not liable for any damages resulting from its unavailability or discontinuation.

---

## 8. User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:

- Evaluating the risks and suitability of using the Protocol.
- Securing your wallet, private keys, and devices used to access the Protocol.
- Verifying the accuracy of any transaction data before interacting with the blockchain.
- Complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and sanctions in your jurisdiction.

We do not assume any duty or liability to assist you in managing these responsibilities or recovering lost assets.

---

## 9. Regulatory and Legal Considerations

The Protocol is not registered with or supervised by any government agency or financial regulatory authority. Its availability in your jurisdiction does not imply legality or compliance with local laws. Blockchain and digital asset technologies face evolving regulatory landscapes, and adverse legal actions could impact your use of the Protocol. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with all applicable laws.

All content, software, and materials related to the Protocol are owned by Kofi Finance or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, or use these materials without our prior written consent, except as permitted under the TOS.
