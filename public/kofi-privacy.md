# Kofi Finance Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: March 17, 2025**  
This Privacy Policy explains how Kofi Finance and its maintainers ("Kofi Finance," "we," "us," or "our") handle information related to your use of Kofi Finance and/or any of its sub-domains (collectively, the "Protocol"). By accessing or using the Protocol, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into the Kofi Protocol Terms of Service and Legal Disclaimer ("TOS"). If you do not agree, you should not use the Protocol.

---

## 1. Overview

Kofi Finance is a decentralized, Aptos-based token staking protocol designed to enable users to stake certain digital assets. As a decentralized system, the Protocol operates on public blockchains and does not inherently collect, store, or process personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the limited circumstances under which we may collect information, how it is used, and your responsibilities regarding your privacy.

We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy to the extent applicable within the decentralized framework of the Protocol. However, because the Protocol interacts with public blockchains, some information you provide may be inherently visible to others.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide

The Protocol does not require or directly collect personal identifiable information (e.g., name, email address, or government-issued ID) for its operation. Your interactions with the Protocol occur solely through your public digital wallet address, which is pseudonymous and not linked to your identity by us. However:

- **Voluntary Disclosure:** If you choose to provide personal or sensitive data (e.g., through public blockchain transactions or external communications with us), such data is not private or secure, and we are not responsible for its protection.

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Information

When you access or use the Protocol, we may collect limited technical information automatically, including:

- **Blockchain Data:** Your public wallet address, transaction details (e.g., staked amounts, timestamps), and interactions with the Protocol’s smart contracts, all of which are recorded on the Aptos blockchain and publicly accessible.
- **IP Addresses:** We may temporarily collect and store IP addresses to monitor usage, detect potential prohibited activities (e.g., access from Restricted Territories), or ensure compliance with the TOS.
- **Device and Usage Data:** Information such as browser type, operating system, referral URLs, and timestamps of your interactions with the Protocol, collected via standard web technologies (e.g., logs or analytics tools).

### 2.3 Third-Party Data

The Protocol relies on third-party services (e.g., wallet providers, blockchain explorers) that may collect additional data about you. We do not control these third parties, and their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies. For example:

- **Wallet Providers:** When you connect a third-party wallet to the Protocol, the wallet provider may collect and store data about your transactions or device.
- **Analytics Tools:** We may use third-party analytics services to understand Protocol usage, which could involve collecting anonymized data.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the limited information we collect solely for the following purposes:

- **Operational Necessity:** To facilitate your interaction with the Protocol, such as processing staking transactions via smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain.
- **Compliance and Security:** To detect, prevent, or investigate potential violations of the TOS, including use by Restricted Persons from Restricted Territories (e.g., United States, China) or Sanctions List Persons, as defined in the TOS.
- **Improvement and Monitoring:** To analyze usage patterns, improve the Protocol’s functionality, and ensure its stability and security.
- **Legal Obligations:** To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal requests (e.g., sanctions enforcement), though such instances are expected to be rare given our decentralized nature.

We do not use your information for marketing, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to the Protocol’s operation and compliance.

---

## 4. How We Share Your Information

The Protocol is non-custodial and decentralized, meaning we do not store or control your digital assets or private keys. Information sharing is limited as follows:

- **Public Blockchain:** Any transaction data (e.g., wallet addresses, staked amounts) you submit to the Protocol is recorded on the Aptos blockchain, which is publicly accessible and beyond our control.
- **Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share technical data (e.g., IP addresses) with third-party analytics or security providers to support Protocol operations, subject to their privacy policies.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or governmental authority, though we will strive to limit such disclosures to the minimum necessary.
- **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell, rent, or trade your information to any party for commercial purposes.

---

## 5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

The Protocol may use cookies or similar technologies (e.g., web beacons) to enhance functionality and monitor usage. These may include:

- **Essential Cookies:** Necessary for the Protocol to operate (e.g., session management).
- **Analytics Cookies:** Used to collect anonymized data about how users interact with the Protocol.

You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings, but disabling essential cookies may impair your ability to use the Protocol. We do not use cookies for advertising or tracking across unrelated sites.

---

## 6. Data Security

As a decentralized protocol, we do not hold custody of your digital assets or private keys, which are your responsibility to secure. For the limited technical data we collect (e.g., IP addresses):

- We implement reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
- However, no internet-based system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of data transmitted to or from the Protocol, especially given its public blockchain integration.

You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, private keys, and any devices used to access the Protocol. Loss of access to these (e.g., due to forgotten keys) cannot be remedied by us.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

Given the Protocol’s decentralized and pseudonymous nature, traditional data rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion) do not fully apply:

- **Blockchain Data:** Transaction data on the Aptos blockchain is immutable and cannot be altered or deleted by us or you.
- **Technical Data:** If we temporarily store data like IP addresses, you may request information about it by contacting us (see Section 11). However, we are not obligated to retain or provide this data beyond operational needs.
- **Opt-Out:** Your primary choice is to stop using the Protocol, as we do not collect personal data requiring opt-out mechanisms like email subscriptions.

---

## 8. International Data Transfers

The Protocol operates on a global blockchain network (Aptos), and any data you submit (e.g., wallet addresses) is inherently accessible worldwide. Technical data we collect (e.g., IP addresses) may be processed in jurisdictions where our maintainers or service providers are located, such as the Cayman Islands or other regions. These jurisdictions may have different data protection laws than yours, and we do not guarantee compliance with your local standards beyond this Privacy Policy.

---

## 9. Third-Party Links and Services

The Protocol may link to or integrate with third-party services (e.g., wallet providers, block explorers). These services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. You should review those policies before interacting with them via the Protocol.

---

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Updates will be indicated by revising the **"Last Updated"** date above. Your continued use of the Protocol after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

---

## 11. Contact Us

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you may contact us at:

- **Email:** <wagmitt@kofi.finance>
- **Response Time:** We aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe, though we are not obligated to provide detailed responses beyond what is required by law or this policy.

---

## 12. Additional Notices

- **No Fiduciary Duty:** This Privacy Policy does not create any fiduciary relationship or duty between you and Kofi Finance.
- **Decentralized Nature:** The Protocol’s reliance on public blockchains means much of your activity is inherently public and outside our control.
