# Kofi Protocol Terms of Service and Legal Disclaimer

**Last Updated: March 17, 2025**  
**Please read this Terms of Service and Legal Disclaimer ("TOS") carefully before accessing or using the Kofi Protocol and/or any of its sub-domains (hereinafter referred to as the "Protocol").**  
By accessing or using the Protocol, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS in its entirety. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use the Protocol.

---

## 1. Overview and Acceptance

The Kofi Protocol is a decentralized, Aptos-based token staking protocol ("Protocol") designed to enable users to stake certain digital assets. Your access to and use of the Protocol is entirely at your own risk.  
The Protocol is provided on an **"as is"** and **"as available"** basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted or error-free operation.

To use the Protocol, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction (whichever is older), capable of forming a legally binding contract online, and not included, directly or indirectly, on any sanctions list enforced by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, or United Nations.
- If acting on behalf of a legal entity, have the legal authority to bind that entity to this TOS.  
  The Protocol is **not offered** to persons or entities who reside in, are citizens of, are incorporated in, or have a registered office in any **Restricted Territory** (defined below), hereinafter referred to as **"Restricted Persons"**. If you are a Restricted Person, you must not attempt to access or use the Protocol. Use of a virtual private network (VPN) or other means to circumvent these restrictions is prohibited. **Restricted Territories** include, but are not limited to, the United States of America, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, and any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive sanctions by the United States, United Kingdom, or European Union.

## 2. Risk Acknowledgment

You acknowledge and accept all risks associated with using the Protocol, digital assets, and decentralized systems, including but not limited to:

- **Volatility:** Digital assets are highly volatile and may experience significant price fluctuations.
- **Inherent Risks:** Using digital assets involves risks due to their features and potential unauthorized actions by third parties (e.g., hacking, phishing, or theft).
- **Access Issues:** You may not have immediate or continuous access to your assets due to technical, network, or other issues.
- **Loss of Assets:** You may lose some or all of your tokens or other assets due to factors within or beyond your control.
- **Third-Party Wallet Risks:** The Protocol is non-custodial and does not control your digital assets, which are held in third-party wallets. Loss of access to your wallet (e.g., private keys, passwords) may result in permanent loss of assets, and Kofi Finance cannot assist in recovery.

You agree that you have no recourse against Kofi Finance, its affiliates, developers, contributors, or any other party for losses arising from your use of the Protocol. Such losses may include, but are not limited to, those caused by:

- Incorrect or incomplete information provided by you or third parties.
- Software, hardware, or network failures (e.g., blockchain congestion or outages).
- Corrupted or compromised cryptocurrency wallet files.
- Unauthorized access to your wallet or accounts.
- Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies in transactions or interactions with the Protocol.
- Malicious third-party activities (e.g., exploits, scams, or attacks).

**Security Note:** While the Protocol may undergo security audits, such audits do not eliminate all risks. The Protocol is not guaranteed to be secure, free from bugs, viruses, or vulnerabilities.

---

## 3. Data Privacy

The Protocol does not collect personal data directly, and your interactions with the Protocol occur solely through your public digital wallet address. However:

- Any personal or sensitive data you voluntarily provide or make available in connection with the Protocol (e.g., through public blockchain transactions) may not be private or secure.
- You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys, wallet credentials, and any other sensitive information.

---

## 4. Dispute Resolution

You agree to resolve any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Protocol or this TOS through **binding arbitration**, except for disputes involving intellectual property rights (e.g., copyrights, logos, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, or patents).

- Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration body, to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, or as determined by applicable law.
- The arbitration will be conducted in English, and the location will be determined based on the governing law (see Section 13).
- **Class Action Waiver:** You waive any right to participate in class actions, collective arbitration, or jury trials related to the Protocol. All disputes must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate multiple claims.
